Welcome to the blog for the [DailyWeight App](https://dailyweight.herokuapp.com/). The app and the blog are written by me, Blake Erickson. I'm just a software developer who like you is on a journey to lose some excess weight.

I noticed that as I tracked my weight regularly I would think more about what I was eating during the day so that I could make the right choices that would help me achieve my weight loss goals. I build the DailyWeight App for myself as a better way to track my performance and I use it every day. I hope you can also find the app to be just as helpful to you.

Thanks for visiting!

-Blake
