title: My DailyWeight Progress Report - May 28th, 2014
---

Today I just wanted to kick off with a post about my weight loss progress.

* Starting Weight: 200.5
* Current Weight: 192.4
* Difference: -8.1
* Percent Change: -4.04%

It has actually taken me since May 9th (20 Days) to lose 8.1 pounds. But I'm pretty happy with my progress so far and hopefully I can finally get to the 189.9 mark this week and out of the 190's.
